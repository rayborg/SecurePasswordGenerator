SecurePasswordGenerator
=======================

First time use:
1. Create a "New Password Profile" 
2. Select Security Questions 
3. Answer your security questions
4. Copy Password

This program creates a folder in "C:\" called SPG which stores settings but the
password nor the password hash are stored. Only the salt is stored locally.

Note: Password is generated by concatenating answers and adding a locally-stored 
securely-generated salt, which is between 510 and 512 bytes in length.


Once at least one password profile is created select it from password profiles.

1. Answer pre-user-selected questions
2. Copy password
